# CSC290FPCode
The code in part 1 and 2 is based on the cuda_hgemm code for SMaT which can be found at https://github.com/spcl/smat (the band matrix test cases can be found from this code repository as well).

Compilation can be done from the part1 or part2 folder by running compile.sh

The dgl-SpMM data was gathered from https://github.com/OnixHoque/sptransx-mlsys2025-reproduce/
